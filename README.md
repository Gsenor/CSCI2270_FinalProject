Minimum Spanning Tree(MST)
                        												  
A minimum spanning tree is a spanning tree of a connected, undirected graph. It connects all the vertices together with the minimal total weighting for its edges.

A single graph can have many different spanning trees. We can also assign a weight to each edge, which is a number representing how unfavorable it is, and use this to assign a weight to a spanning tree by computing the sum of the weights of the edges in that spanning tree. A minimum spanning tree(MST) or minimum weight spanning tree is a spanning tree with the least weight. 

There are quite a few use cases for minimum spanning trees. One representative example known broadly is a telecommunication company
which is trying to lay out cables in new neighborhood. If it is constrained to bury the cable only along certain paths, then there would be a graph representing which points are connected by those paths. Some of those paths might be more expensive, because they are longer or require the cable to be buried deeper. These paths would be represented by edges with larger weights(=cost).
